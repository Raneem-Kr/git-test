                <h3>What is type 1 diabetes?</h3>
                <p><span>Diabetes occurs when </span> your <span>blood glucose</span>, also called blood sugar, is <span>too high</span>. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes mainly from the food you eat. <span>Insulin</span>, a hormone made by the pancreas, <span>helps</span> the <span>glucose</span> in your blood get <span>into your cells </span>to be used <span>for energy</span>. Another hormone, <span>glucagon</span>, works with insulin to <span>control blood glucose</span> levels. In most people with type 1 diabetes, the body’s <span>immune system</span>, which normally fights infection, <span>attacks</span> and <span>destroys the cells in the pancreas</span> that make insulin. As a <span>result</span>, your <span>pancreas stops making insulin</span>. <span>Without insulin</span>, <span>glucose can’t</span> get into your cells and your <span>blood glucose rises</span> above normal. People with type 1 diabetes need to <span> take insulin </span>every day to stay alive.</p>

                <p>Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in <span>children</span> and <span>young adults</span>, although it can appear at any age. Having a <span>parent </span>or <span>sibling</span> with the disease may increase your chance of developing type 1 diabetes.

                <h2>Symptoms & Causes</h2>
                <h3>What are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes?</h3>
                <p>Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are serious and usually <span>happen quickly</span>, over a few days to weeks. Symptoms can include:</p>
                <ul class="pl-3">
                    <li>
                        increased thirst and urination
                    </li>
                    <li>increased hunger</li>
                    <li>blurred vision</li>
                    <li>fatigue</li>
                    <li>unexplained weight loss</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sometimes the first symptoms of type 1 diabetes are signs of a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some symptoms of DKA include:</p>
                <ul class="pl-3">
                    <li>
                        breath that smells fruity
                    </li>
                    <li>dry or flushed skin</li>
                    <li>nausea or vomiting</li>
                    <li>stomach pain</li>
                    <li> trouble breathing </li>
                    <li>trouble paying attention or feeling confused</li>
                </ul>
                <p>DKA is serious and dangerous. If you or your child have symptoms of DKA, contact your health care professional right away, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room.</p>

                <h4>What medicines do I need to treat my type 1 diabetes?</h4>
                <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, you must take <span>insulin</span> because your body no longer makes this hormone. Different types of insulin start to work at different speeds, and the effects of each last a different length of time. You may need to use more than one type. You can take insulin a number of ways. Common options include a <span>needle</span> and <span>syringe</span>, spinsulin pen, or <span>insulin pump</span>. Some people who have trouble reaching their <span>blood glucose targets</span> with <span>insulin alone</span> also might need to take another type of <span>diabetes medicine</span> that works with insulin, such as <span>pramlintide</span> Pramlintide, given by <span>injection</span>, helps <span>keep blood glucose</span> levels from going too high after eating. Few people with type 1 diabetes take pramlintide, however. The NIH has recently funded a large research study to test use of pramlintide along with insulin and glucagon in people with type 1 diabetes. Another diabetes medicine, <span>metformin</span>, may help <span>decrease the amount of insulin you need to take</span>, but more studies are needed to confirm this. Reseachers are also studying other diabetes pills that people with type 1 diabetes might take along with insulin. <span>Hypoglycemia</span>, or low blood sugar, can occur if you take <span>insulin but don’t match your dose with your food or physical activity</span>. Severe hypoglycemia can be dangerous and needs to be treated right away. Learn more about hypoglycemia and how to prevent or treat it.

                <h3>How else can I manage type 1 diabetes?</h3>
                <p>Along with <span>insulin</span> and any othersp
                    medicines you use, you can manage your diabetes by taking care of yourself each day. Following your diabetes <span>meal plan</span>, being <span>physically active</span>, and <span>checking your blood glucose often</span> are some of the ways you can take care of yourself. Work with your <span>health care team</span> to come up with a diabetes care plan that works for you. If you are planning a pregnancy with diabetes, try to get your blood glucose levels in your target range before you get pregnant.</p>
