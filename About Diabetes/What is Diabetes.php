                        <p> <span>Diabetes</span> is a disease that <span>occurs when</span> your <span>blood glucose</span>, also called blood sugar, is <span>too high</span>. <span>Glucose is</span> your body’s <span>main source of energy</span>. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food you eat. <span>Insulin is</span> a <span>hormone</span> made by the pancreas <span>that helps glucose get into your cells to be used for </span><span>energy</span>. If you have diabetes, your body doesn’t make <span>enough—or any—insulin</span>, or <span>doesn’t use insulin properly</span>. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells. Diabetes raises the risk for damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. Taking steps to prevent or manage diabetes may lower your risk of developing diabetes health problems.</p>

                        <p>To understand why Insulin is <span>important</span> in diabetes, it helps to know more about how the body uses food for energy. Your body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, these cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of your food is broken down into a simple sugar called <span> "glucose"</span>. Then, glucose is transported through the bloodstream to the cells of your body where it can be used to provide some of the energy your body needs for daily activities. The amount of glucose in your bloodstream is tightly regulated by the hormone <span>insulin</span>. Insulin is always being released in small amounts by the <span>pancreas</span>. When the amount of glucose in your blood <span>rises</span> to a certain level, the pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into the cells. This causes the glucose levels in your blood (blood glucose levels) to drop. To keep your blood glucose levels from getting <span>too low </span>(hypoglycemia or low blood sugar), your body signals you to eat and releases some glucose from storage kept in the liver. People with diabetes either <span>don't make insulin</span> or their <span>body's cells are resistant to insulin</span>, leading to <span>high </span>levels of sugar circulating in the blood, called simply <span>high blood sugar</span>. By definition, diabetes is having a blood glucose level of <span>126 milligrams</span> per deciliter (mg/dL) or more after an overnight fast (not eating anything).</p>

                                <p> If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes <span>little</span> or <span>no insulin</span>. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in <span>children</span> and <span>young adults</span>, although it <span>can</span> appear at <span>any age</span>. People with type 1 diabetes need to take <span>insulin every day</span> to stay alive.</p>

                                <p>If you have type 2 diabetes, the cells in your body <span>don’t</span> use insulin properly. The pancreas may be making insulin but is not making <span>enough insulin</span> to keep your blood <span>glucose level</span> in the <span> normal</span> range. Type 2 diabetes is the <span>most common type</span> of diabetes. You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you have risk factors, such as <span>overweight</span> or <span>obesity</span>, and a family history of the disease. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. You can help <span>delay</span> or <span>prevent</span> type 2 diabetes by knowing the <span>risk factors</span> and taking steps toward a <span>healthier lifestyle</span>, such as losing weight or preventing weight gain.</p>

                                <p>Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during <span>pregnancy</span>. Most of the time, this type of diabetes <span>goes away</span> <span>after</span> the baby is <span>born</span>. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is type 2 diabetes.</p>
