                    A <span>meal plan</span> is your <span>guide</span> for when, what, and how much to eat to get the <span>nutrition you need</span> while <span>keeping your blood sugar</span> levels in your target range. A <span>good meal plan</span> will consider your goals, tastes, and lifestyle, as well as any medicines you’re taking. <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                <h6 class="pb-2"> A good meal plan will also:</h6>
                <ul class="pl-3 pb-2">
                    <li>Include <span>more nonstarchy </span>vegetables, such as broccoli, spinach, and green beans.</li>
                    <li>Include <span>fewer</span> added <span> sugars</span> and refined grains, such as white bread, rice, and pasta with less than 2 grams of fiber</li>
                    <li> Focus on <span>whole foods</span> instead of highly processed foods as much as possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <span>Carbohydrates</span> in the food you eat <span>raise</span> your <span>blood sugar</span> levels. How fast carbs raise your blood sugar depends on <span>what the food</span> is and <span>what you eat with it</span>. For example, drinking <span>fruit juice</span> raises blood sugar <span>faster</span> than eating <span> whole fruit</span>. Eating carbs with foods that have protein, fat, or fiber slows down how quickly your blood sugar rises. <br> <br>

                You’ll want to plan for <span> regular</span>, <span>balanced</span> meals to <span>avoid</span> <span>high</span> or <span>low blood sugar </span>levels. Eating about the <span>same amount</span> of carbs at each meal can be <span> helpful</span>. <span>Counting carbs</span> and using the <span>plate method</span> are two <span>common tools</span> that can make <span>planning meals</span> easier too.

                    Counting Carbs
                </h2>
                <p>Keeping track of <span> how many carbs</span> you eat and setting a <span>limit</span> for each meal can help <span>keep</span> your <span>blood sugar</span> levels in your <span>target range</span>. Work with your doctor or a registered dietitian to find out how many carbs you can eat each day and at each meal, and then refer to this list of common foods that contain carbs and serving sizes.</p>

                <h2>The Plate Method</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s easy to eat <span>more food</span> than you need <span>without realizing</span> it. The <span>plate method</span> is a simple, visual way to <span>make sure</span> you get <span>enough nonstarchy</span> <span>vegetables</span> and <span>lean protein</span> while <span>limiting </span>the amount of <span>higher-carb</span> foods you eat that have the highest impact on your blood sugar. <br>
                    Start with <span>a 9-inch dinner plate</span> (about the length of a business envelope):
                <ul class="pl-3">
                    <li>Fill <span>half</span> with <span>nonstarchy vegetables</span>, such as salad, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and carrots.</li>
                    <li>Fill <span>one quarter</span> with a <span>lean protein</span>, such as chicken, turkey, beans, tofu, or eggs.</li>
                    <li>Fill <span>one quarter</span> with <span>carb foods</span>. Foods that are higher in carbs include grains, starchy vegetables (such as potatoes and peas), rice, pasta, beans, fruit, and yogurt. A cup of milk also counts as a carb food.</li>
                </ul>
                Then choose <span>water</span> or a <span>low-calorie</span> drink such as unsweetened iced tea to go with your meal.

                <h2>About Portion Size</h2>
                <p>
                    <span>Portion size</span> and <span>serving size</span> aren’t always the same. A <span>portion</span> is <span>the amount</span> of food you choose to eat at one time, while a <span>serving</span> is a <span>specific amount</span> of food, such as one slice of bread or 8 ounces (1 cup) of milk. <br>
                    These days, portions at restaurants are quite a bit larger than they were several years ago. One entrée can equal 3 or 4 servings! Studies show that people tend to eat more when they’re served more food, so getting portions under control is really important for managing weight and blood sugar. <br>
                    If you’re <span> eating out</span>, have <span>half of your meal wrapped up</span> to go so you can enjoy it later. <span>At home</span>, measure out snacks; <span>don’t eat straight from the bag or box</span>. <span>At dinnertime</span>, <span>reduce </span>the <span>temptation</span> to go back for seconds by keeping the serving bowls out of reach. And with this “handy” guide, you’ll always have a way to estimate portion size at your fingertips:
